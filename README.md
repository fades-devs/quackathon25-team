## Inspiration
- The main character was inspired by the Duck mascot of the event.
- The platform GameMaker was very interesting to work on and easy to use for 2D games.
- We were also partially inspired by the term "lucky egg" mentioned in the challenge since it aligned with the theme of DUCS mascot.

## What it does
The context of the game is that a cute little duck goes on a war against the geese for stealing his precious egg.<br/>
When he finds the egg finally he goes on a rampage mode that makes much more powerful helping him defeating the entire mafia.

## How we built it
- We got few basic assets online for the sprites and had to create some on our own and built rooms with the assets.
- We used GameMaker's scripting language (GML Code) to create events within the game using different functions, variables and control flow statements.
- The characters are made to be interactive with the help of audio and animations.

## Challenges
- Getting familiar with the GameMaker Tool within the short time period.
- Editing assets within the GameMaker Tool.

## Accomplishments
- Built a fully functional 2D game with an unfamiliar tool under 24 hours.
- Catchy storyline.
- Consistent styling of the game.
- Melee combat mechanics.
- Troubleshooting using GameMaker's GML Manual.
